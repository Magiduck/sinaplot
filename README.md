# sinaplot
Sinaplot implementation in Python adapted from https://github.com/mparker2/seaborn_sinaplot

Adapted to include a boxplot in the middle of the sinaplot.

Ugly implementation for now: ```showboxplot=True, boxplotdata=data``` in which ```boxplotdata=data``` is a python list of numpy arrays or pandas series.
